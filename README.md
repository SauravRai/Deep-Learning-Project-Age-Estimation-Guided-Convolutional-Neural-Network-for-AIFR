# Age Estimation Guided Convolutional Neural Network for AIFR
This repository contains the Pytorch implementation of the paper Age Estimation Guided Convolutional Neural Network for Age Invariant Face Recogntion, Tianyue Zheng, Weihong Deng, Jiani Hu , CVPR , 2017
The folder contains the implementation for both datasets.

# Requirements 
1. PyTorch 0.4.1
2. Numpy
3. Sklearn

# Datasets  
1. MORPH Dataset
2. CACD Dataset

Both datasets are publicly available. Kindly download and preprocess the datasets before training the model.

# Training 
For training the model kindly use the following command
```python main.py```
